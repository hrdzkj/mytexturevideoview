Change Log
==========

Version 1.2.1
-------------

 * clear the underlying `Surface` on API level 16+ when calling `stopPlayback()` (see #15, thanks to @hithere1985)

Version 1.2.0
-------------

 * synced TextureVideoView with latest sources from Android 7.1.1_r13
   (constructor improvements, code formatting)
 * API addition: Call `setShouldRequestAudioFocus(true)` to programmatically disable audio focus request before opening a video file -
   default behaviour is unchanged and complies with the current `VideoView` implementation
   (see #14, thanks to @ezaquarii)

Version 1.1.1
-------------

 * fixed potential activity leak caused by AudioMananger on Android pre-6.0 devices (thanks to @hzsweers)

Version 1.1.0
-------------

 * synced TextureVideoView with latest sources from Android 6.0.1_r10
   (un-hides [setVideoURI(Uri uri, Map<String, String> headers)][1],
   uses proper audio focus, source code indention)
 * reverted to Android framework behaviour: OnCompletionListener may be called more than once again
   (see #6, thanks to @MrNovado)

   **This may break your code!** The OnCompletionListener itself is now responsible for guarding
   any unwanted invocation.
